# Snack Game
## About the Projectüí°
we will create a snake game with the help of C++ and graphics functions. In this, we will use the concept of c++ classes and computer graphics functions.Snake game is one of the most famous games available on all types of device and works on every operating system. Snakes can move in every direction in this game, e.g., left, right, up, and down; after taking the food, the length of the snake increases. Food of the Snake will be generated at a given interval of time.
- Graphics primitives in C++
A graphics primitive is an essential non divisible graphical element for input or output within a computer graphics system. We need a header file called <graphics.h> to draw and create any graphics on the screen. It can also be defined as how a computer displays the data pictorially and manipulates it. Apart from drawing figures of various shapes, all animations and multimedia mainly work in the graphics platform.
- The following functions are used to create graphics in the snake game:

- Initgraph():
- closegraph():
- outtext():
- outtextxy():
